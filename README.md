# Hi, I'm Jose Mayo! 👋

I’m a Python developer with a certification through Holberton Coding School in San Juan, P.R., currently specializing in Cybersecurity.

I enjoy building backend systems, automating tasks, and exploring the intersection between software development and security.

My projects include REST APIs, automation scripts, and beginner-level security tools. I’m eager to grow as a developer and contribute to meaningful, real-world software—especially in remote and collaborative environments.

Feel free to explore my repositories and reach out if you’d like to connect or collaborate! 🚀
